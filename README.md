# Multi-Panel Stacked Area Chart using Stata | A step-by-step guide

The Stata code shared in this repository will help create a multi-panel stacked area chart which is useful for many scenarios especially when you are interested in looking at the distribution of multiple groups side by side while each groups contains hundreds of observations. 

This is my simple take on how to visualize such information without crowding the canvas of the plot. 

A guide on this can me found on Medium:
